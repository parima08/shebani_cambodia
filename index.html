This curiosity fueled the inspiration for this project on the marble carvers in the small northern province of Pursat in Cambodia. I have always showed favouritism towards the niches of society. </p>

							<h1>Nothing is set in Stone: a tale of a local marble community in Cambodia</h1>
							<p></p>
							<blockquote class="team-quote">
								<p>"Sun sits in the shaded area, still and composed, back straight like a school child on his best behaviour. Even when the flies take turns to rest on his nose, he remains unperturbed.

In passing, he would sneak in a soft smile or chuckle, which exaggerated the visibility of the lines etched on his face.</p>

<p>Preferring silence over words, Sun's eyes spoke the loudest. Sometimes sad, sometimes affectionate, sometimes scarred, the emotions change with the stories he told.

Clad in casuals, Sun is in a white undershirt and slacks.

At first glance no one would have guessed that people from all over Cambodia have come to the small northern province of Pursat just to order his marble elephant carvings." </p>

						<h1>This project would have not been possible without</h1>
							<div class="avatar" style = "float: left; margin: 10px 40px; "><img src="img/reksmey.png" alt="User Avatar"></div>
							<p>
							Firstly, I would like to thank Reksmey So, age 23 from Phnom Penh, who was my translator, guide, and most importantly a friend throughout the trip. The entire project could not have been possible without her. </p>

							<p>Reksmey is an undergraduate student who is majoring in International Relations at the Pannasastra University of Cambodia.  She currently is employed as a learning facilitator and an afterschool extension coordinator at the Liger Learning Centre. Reksmey also served as an Americorps member from 2013-14.</p>

							<p>Working with her was a pleasure. For me, coming alone to a country without knowing anyone was slightly daunting. Yet her natural ability to put others first and be there as my support, is a rare find.</p>

						 <p>For the project, Reksmey translated all the interview recordings and documents that were in Khmer. She also accompanied me to every face-to-face interview in Cambodia and translated when necessary. Her patience, support, and willingness for adventure made the impossible, possible.<p>

							<p>I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the people of Cambodia who opened their heart and homes to me, a stranger in their country. They made me feel like one of them and were always eager to talk. This immersive cultural experience was one that could not be replicated or created again. </p>

							<p>I would like to thank all the organisations, international and local, and who made the time to answer questions and provide me with supplementary learning resources and further support. </p>

							<p>A special note of thanks to my tutors Paul Bolding and Marcus Gilroy-Ware from City University and Parima Shah from Ciklum for sharing their expert opinions and guiding me through the entire project.</p>

							<p>Last but not least, a big thank you to my parents Piyush and Varsha Shah for their unwavering support that made this trip possible. </p>

				If we keep looking at the bigger picture we might miss the individual drops that create the ocean. </p>

				<p>I, a person with obsessive curiosity disorder, always crave to know the stories behind people, things, places, etc. </p>

				<p>As someone who visits Indian temples often, I cannot help but zoom my face in so close to the intricate carvings, my nose almost touching the marble, and wonder: </p>

				<a></a>
				<p>What are the stories behind the sculpture, the ones that gave it life: Who designed the sculpture and why? What did it symbolize? How was it made? </p>

				<p>This curiosity fueled the inspiration for this project on the marble carvers in the small northern province of Pursat in Cambodia. I have always showed favouritism towards the niches of society. </p>

				<p>While in-depth stories like the one I decided to do may not make the national news, I believe that they do reflect, to some extent, the state and culture of a country. There’s an element of sensitivity in the microscopic stories that I believe give them a power to have an impact on and touch the reader; it is a sharing of human experience that cannot be recreated. </p>

				<p>So the journey of the multimedia final project began with typing  “marble carvers” in Google and the picking of random countries. Cambodia happened to surface. After extensive research over the web, I realised this is the topic I wanted to cover. </p>

				<p>While the local marble community is a small pocket of people within a province in Cambodia, the story represents a wide scale issue at hand affecting the Cambodian society. </p>

				<p>The local marble business speaks to a larger narrative about how since the time the government began to invest heavily on the development of the country, it has been affecting not only the environment but the local communities as well. People who were able to sustain themselves for decades, are now uncertain of their future in a matter of seconds. After years of lax regulation on economic development and natural resource extraction, the alarm bell is sounding louder than ever. </p> 

				<p>And yes, this story of Cambodia can be told through one province…no smaller… in one community…no even smaller… one rock. </p>
